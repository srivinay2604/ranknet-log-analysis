# RankNet Log Analysis Project

A machine learning project for analyzing web server logs using a RankNet-inspired approach to rank log entries by relevance.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project processes web server logs, engineers features, generates pairwise training data, and implements a ranking model to predict the relevance of log entries. It includes an interactive UI built with ipywidgets for easy execution.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Handles missing values and data type conversions
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates time-based, request-based, and status-based features
- **Relevance Scoring**: Assigns pseudo-relevance scores based on log heuristics
- **Pairwise Data Generation**: Creates training pairs for ranking algorithms
- **RankNet Template**: Implements a pairwise ranking model using logistic regression
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for running the analysis
